Assignment 3: Back-End Development
Description
In this assignment, you will build the back end for the web or mobile application that you designed in Assignment 1. Remember, we are only focusing on the back end in this assignment.

Problem Statement
Same as assignment 1.

Additional Details
Back end must include the following components/modules:

Login Module: Handle user authentication, registration, and login functionality.
User Profile Management Module: Manage user profile data, including location, skills, preferences, and availability.
Event Management Module: Create and manage events, including required skills, location, urgency, and event details.
Volunteer Matching Module: Implement logic to match volunteers to events based on their profiles and event requirements.
Notification Module: Logic to send notifications to volunteers for event assignments, updates, and reminders.
Volunteer History Module: Track and display volunteer participation history.
Pricing Module: Only create a class. You will implement this in the last assignment.
Important Deliverables
Validations: Ensure validations are in place for required fields, field types, and field lengths in the backend code.
Unit Tests: All backend code should be covered by unit tests. Code coverage should be greater than 80%. Research how to run the code coverage reports. Each IDE has plugins to generate reports. Here are a few pointers: Stackify Code Coverage ToolsLinks to an external site.
Integration with Front End: All front-end components should be connected to the back end. Form data should be populated from the back end. The back end should receive data from the front end, validate it, and prepare it to persist to the database.
No Database Implementation: We are not implementing the database yet. For this assignment, you can hard code the values.
